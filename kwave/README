Kwave (sound editor for the KDE)

Kwave is a sound editor designed for the KDE  Desktop Environment.
With Kwave you can edit many sorts of wav-files including
multi-channel files. You are able to alter and play back each channel
on its own.
Kwave also includes many plugins (most are still under development)
to transform the wave-file in several ways and presents a graphical
view with a complete zoom- and scroll capability.
