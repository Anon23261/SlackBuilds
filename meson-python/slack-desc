# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

meson-python: meson-python (Meson PEP 517 Python build backend)
meson-python:
meson-python: meson-python is a Python build backend built on top of the Meson
meson-python: build system. It enables to use Meson for the configuration and build
meson-python: steps of Python packages. Meson is an open source build system meant
meson-python: to be both extremely fast, and, even more importantly, as user
meson-python: friendly as possible. meson-python is best suited for building Python
