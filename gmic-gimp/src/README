GMIC (image procession framework)

G'MIC stands for GREYC's Magic Image Converter. This project aims to:
Define a minimal but powerful script language (G'MIC) dedicated to the
design of image processing pipelines.
Provide an interpreter of this language (in C++), distributed as an
open-source module/library embeddable in third-party applications.
Propose two binary tools embedding this interpreter:
- The command-line executable gmic to use the framework from a shell.
- The interactive plug-in to GIMP.
