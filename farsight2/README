farsight (framework audio/video)

The Farsight project is an effort to create a framework to deal with
all known audio/video conferencing protocols. On one side it offers a
generic API that makes it possible to write plugins for different 
streaming protocols, on the other side it offers an API for clients 
to use those plugins.
