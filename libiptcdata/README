libiptcdata (IPTC Information Interchange Model)

libiptcdata is a library, written in C, for manipulating the
International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) metadata
stored within multimedia files such as images. This metadata can
include captions and keywords, often used by popular photo management
applications. The library provides routines for parsing, viewing,
modifying, and saving this metadata.
