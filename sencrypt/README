sencrypt (utilities for encrypting and decrypting data)

sencrypt and sdecrypt are utilities for encrypting and decrypting
data with the AES, DES, 3DES, and RC4 algorithms. It can read
keys from files or ask for a passphrase and use that together
with a salt to derive a key using the PBKDF2 key derivation
function.
