# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

node-unminify: A little project to undo several of the horrible things JavaScript
node-unminify: build tools will do to JavaScript. In addition to undoing most
node-unminify: minification, it reverses some of the stupider but surprisingly
node-unminify: common "obfuscation" techniques used in the wild.
