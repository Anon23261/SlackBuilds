# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

collectd: collectd (system statistics collection daemon)
collectd:
collectd: collectd is a small daemon which collects system information
collectd: periodically and provides mechanisms to monitor and store the values
collectd: in a variety of ways. Since the daemon doesn't need to startup every
collectd: time it wants to update the values it's very fast and easy on the
collectd: system. Also, the statistics are very fine grained since the files
collectd: are updated every 10 seconds.
