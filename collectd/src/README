collectd (system statistics collection daemon)

collectd is a small daemon which collects system information
periodically and provides mechanisms to monitor and store the values
in a variety of ways. Since the daemon doesn't need to startup every
time it wants to update the values it's very fast and easy on the
system. Also, the statistics are very fine grained since the files
are updated every 10 seconds.
