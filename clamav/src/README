clamav (a GPL-ed virus scanner)

Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose
of this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded
daemon, a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via
Internet. Most importantly, the virus database is kept up to date.
For setup, see README.slackware in the /usr/doc/clamav-*  directory.
