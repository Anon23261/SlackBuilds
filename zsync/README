zsync (client-side implementation of the rsync algorithm)

zsync is a file transfer program. It allows you to download a file
from a remote web server, where you have a copy of an older version of
the file on your computer already. zsync downloads only the new parts
of the file. It uses the same algorithm as rsync.
