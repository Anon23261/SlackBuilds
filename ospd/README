ospd (Open Scanner Protocol Wrapper)

OSPD is a base class for scanner wrappers which share the same
communication protocol: OSP (Open Scanner Protocol). OSP creates a
unified interface for different security scanners and makes their
control flow and scan results consistently available under the
central Greenbone Vulnerability Manager service.
