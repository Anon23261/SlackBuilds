Apachetop (top-like display of Apache logs)

Apachetop is a curses-based top-like display for Apache information,
including requests per second, bytes per second, most popular URLs,
etc... 
Apachetop watches a logfile generated by Apache (in standard common
or combined logformat, although it doesn't (yet) make use of any of
the extra fields in combined) and generates human-parsable output in realtime.
