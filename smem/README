smem (memory reporting tool)

smem is a tool that can give numerous reports on memory usage on
Linux systems.  Unlike existing tools, smem can report proportional
set size (PSS), which is a more meaningful representation of the
amount of memory used by libraries and applications in a virtual
memory system.
