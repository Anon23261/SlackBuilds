mjpegtools (video recording/playback tools)

The mjpeg programs are a set of tools that can do recording of videos
and playback, simple cut-and-paste editing and the MPEG compression 
of audio and video under Linux.

The recorded videos can be converted to MPEG streams. The software 
playback of MPEG streams works with almost every player and every OS.
