digiKam (KDE Photo Management Application)

digiKam is a simple digital photo management application for KDE,
which makes importing and organizing digital photos a "snap". The
photos can be organized in albums which can be sorted chronologically,
by directory layout or by custom collections. An easy to use interface
is provided that enables you to connect to your camera and preview,
download and/or delete your images.
