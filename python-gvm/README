python-gvm (GVM Python Library)

The Greenbone Vulnerability Management Python API library (python-gvm)
is a collection of APIs that help with remote controlling a Greenbone
Security Manager (GSM) appliance and its underlying Greenbone
Vulnerability Manager (GVM). The library essentially abstracts
accessing the communication protocols Greenbone Management Protocol
(GMP) and Open Scanner Protocol (OSP).
