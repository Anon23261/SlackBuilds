qtcurve (KDE4 style)

This is a set of widget styles for KDE4 based apps
The   underlying  code  is  based  upon  Blue/FreeCurve  -  however
*extensive* modifications have been made. The fonts and colours for
the GTK  themes will  be read in from your Qt settings - so any KDE
font/colour changes will also affect your GTK apps.
