# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

node-yarn: node-yarn (Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management).
node-yarn:
node-yarn: Fast: Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to
node-yarn: download the same package again. It also parallelizes operations to
node-yarn: maximize resource utilization so install times are faster than ever.
node-yarn: Reliable: Using a detailed, concise lockfile format and a
node-yarn: deterministic algorithm for installs, Yarn is able to guarantee that
node-yarn: an install that worked on one system will work exactly the same way
node-yarn: Secure: Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every
node-yarn: installed package before its code is executed.
