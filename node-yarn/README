node-yarn (Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management).

Fast: Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to
download the same package again. It also parallelizes operations to
maximize resource utilization so install times are faster than ever.
Reliable: Using a detailed, concise lockfile format and a
deterministic algorithm for installs, Yarn is able to guarantee that
an install that worked on one system will work exactly the same way
Secure: Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every
installed package before its code is executed.
