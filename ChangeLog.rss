I found the patches to compile PostgreSQL with llvm-17 on
the PostgreSQL mailing list, plus a modification of my own.
I don't use PostgreSQL intensively enough to know if it's ok,
if someone can try it would be good. Thanks.
postgresql-16.0-x86_64-2cf.txz:  Rebuilt.
    - Recompiled against llvm-17.0.1.

    - This package is required by numpy to compile.
    - Since, however, it also requires Cython >= 0.29.30,
    - for now I have left pip as the package build method.
    - I hope Pat will update Cython soon,
    - to try using python-installer, instead of pip.
    - Would also need to update python-setuptools_scm to version 7.
