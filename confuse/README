Confuse (configuration file parser library)

Confuse is a configuration file parser library. It supports sections
and (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats, booleans or other
sections), as well as some other features (such as
single/double-quoted strings, environment variable expansion,
functions, and nested include statements).
