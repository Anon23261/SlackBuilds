# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

paperkey: A reasonable way to achieve a long term backup of OpenPGP keys is to
paperkey: print them out on paper. The reasoning behind this is that paper and
paperkey: ink has amazingly long retention qualities - far longer than the
paperkey: magnetic or optical means that are generally used to back up computer
paperkey: data.
