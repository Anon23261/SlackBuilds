paperkey (OpenPGP key archiver)

A reasonable way to achieve a long term backup of OpenPGP keys is to
print them out on paper. The reasoning behind this is that paper and
ink has amazingly long retention qualities - far longer than the
magnetic or optical means that are generally used to back up computer
data.
