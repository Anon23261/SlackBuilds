tcprelay

Tcpreplay is a suite which gives you the ability to use previously 
captured traffic in libpcap format to test a variety of network 
devices. It allows you to classify traffic as client or server, 
rewrite Layer 2, 3 and 4 headers and finally replay the traffic back 
onto the network and through other devices such as switches, routers,
firewalls, NIDS and IPS's.
