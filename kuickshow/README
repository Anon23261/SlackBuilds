KuickShow (Image Viewer from KDE Extragear)

KuickShow is a very fast image viewer. It starts up with a folder 
view allowing for browsing of local and remote folders. From there 
you can display images, either in a separate window or in full screen
mode. You can quickly switch to the next or previous image in the same
directory. Images are automatically scaled to the best possible 
display size, and rotated if the EXIF orientation tag is present. 
Alternatively you can rotate or flip them easily.
