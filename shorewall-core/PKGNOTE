shorewall consists of 3 packages:
* shorewall-core, containing the common elements to both IPv4 and IPv6 components
* shorewall, the IPv4 component
* shorewall6, the IPv6 component

The shorewall-core package is needed for both,
but you must install at least one of the other two,
depending on your network type.


Start Shorewall on boot by adding the following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local
or /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.shorewall ]; then
/etc/rc.d/rc.shorewall start
fi

Or rename rc.shorewall to rc.firewall
