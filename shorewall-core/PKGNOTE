shorewall consists of 3 packages:
* shorewall-core, containing the common elements to both IPv4 and IPv6 components
* shorewall, the IPv4 component
* shorewall6, the IPv6 component

The shorewall-core package is needed for both,
but you must install at least one of the other two,
depending on your network type.
