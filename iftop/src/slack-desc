# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

iftop: iftop does for network usage what top(1) does for CPU usage. It
iftop: listens to network traffic on a named interface and displays a table
iftop: of current bandwidth usage by pairs of hosts. Handy for answering the
iftop: question "Why is my Internet link so slow?".
