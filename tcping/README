tcping (utility that check of TCP connection to a given IP/Port)

tcping does a TCP connect to the given IP/Port combination.
The user can specify a timeout in seconds.
This is useful in shell scripts running in firewalled environments.
Often SYNs are just being dropped by firewalls, thus connection
establishment will be retried several times (for minutes) until a TCP
timeout is reached. With tcping it is possible to check first if the
desired port is reachable and then start connection establishment.
