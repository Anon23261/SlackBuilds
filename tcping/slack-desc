# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tcping: establishment will be retried several times (for minutes) until a TCP
tcping: timeout is reached. With tcping it is possible to check first if the
tcping: desired port is reachable and then start connection establishment.
