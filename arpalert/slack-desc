# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

arpalert: arpalert (monitoring ethernet networks)
arpalert:
arpalert: Arpalert listens on a network interface (without using 'promiscuous' 
arpalert: mode) and catches all conversations of MAC address to IP request.
arpalert: It then compares the mac addresses it detected with a pre-configured
arpalert: list of authorized MAC addresses. If the MAC is not in list, arpalert
arpalert: launches a pre-defined user script with the MAC address and IP address
arpalert: as parameters.
