# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

sparse: sparse (Semantic parser for C)
sparse:
sparse: Sparse, the semantic parser, provides a compiler frontend capable of
sparse: parsing most of ANSI C as well as many GCC extensions, and a
sparse: collection of sample compiler backends, including a static analyzer
sparse: also called "sparse". Sparse provides a set of annotations designed
sparse: to convey semantic information about types, such as what address
sparse: space pointers point to, or what locks a function acquires or
sparse: releases.
