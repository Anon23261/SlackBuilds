# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

ecryptfs-utils:
ecryptfs-utils: eCryptfs is a cryptographic filesystem for Linux. It provides advanced
ecryptfs-utils: key management and policy features. eCryptfs stores cryptographic 
ecryptfs-utils: metadata in the header of each file written, so that encrypted files 
ecryptfs-utils: can be copied between hosts; the file will be decryptable with the 
ecryptfs-utils: proper key, and there is no need to keep track of any additional 
ecryptfs-utils: information aside from what is already in the encrypted file itself.
