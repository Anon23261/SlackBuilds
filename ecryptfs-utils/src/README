ecryptfs-utils (ecryptfs cryptographic filesystem utilities)

eCryptfs is a cryptographic filesystem for Linux. It provides advanced
key management and policy features. eCryptfs stores cryptographic 
metadata in the header of each file written, so that encrypted files 
can be copied between hosts; the file will be decryptable with the 
proper key, and there is no need to keep track of any additional 
information aside from what is already in the encrypted file itself.
