# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

websocketpp: websocketpp (C++ websocket client/server library)
websocketpp:
websocketpp: WebSocket++ is a header only C++ library that implements RFC6455 The
websocketpp: WebSocket Protocol. It allows integrating WebSocket client and server
websocketpp: functionality into C++ programs. It uses interchangeable network
websocketpp: transport modules including one based on raw char buffers, one based
websocketpp: on C++ iostreams, and one based on Asio (either via Boost or
websocketpp: standalone). End users can write additional transport policies to
websocketpp: support other networking or event libraries as needed.
