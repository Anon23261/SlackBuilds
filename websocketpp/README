websocketpp (C++ websocket client/server library)

WebSocket++ is a header only C++ library that implements RFC6455 The
WebSocket Protocol. It allows integrating WebSocket client and server
functionality into C++ programs. It uses interchangeable network
transport modules including one based on raw char buffers, one based
on C++ iostreams, and one based on Asio (either via Boost or
standalone). End users can write additional transport policies to
support other networking or event libraries as needed.
