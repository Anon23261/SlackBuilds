GSL (a numerical library for C and C++ programmers)

The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
numerical computing. The routines are written from scratch by the
GSL team in ANSI C, and present a modern API for C programmers,
while allowing wrappers to be written for very high-level
languages.
