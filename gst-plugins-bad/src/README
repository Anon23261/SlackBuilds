gst-plugins-bad (Gstreamer Bad Plug-ins)

GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to
par compared to the rest. They might be close to being good 
quality, but they're missing something - be it a good code 
review, some documentation, a set of tests, a real live 
maintainer, or some actual wide use.
