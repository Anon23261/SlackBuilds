barnyard2 (Snort output processor)

Barnyard2 is a fork of the original barnyard project, designed
specifically for Snort's new unified2 file format. It is a critical
tool for the parsing of Snort's binary log files to a variety of
output plugins, capable of asynchronously processing, while Snort
continues it's job.
