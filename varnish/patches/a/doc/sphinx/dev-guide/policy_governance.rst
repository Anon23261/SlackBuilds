Project Truck Factor and Governance
-----------------------------------

We recognize that the Truck Factor of the Varnish Cache project is low.

As mitigation we have created a Varnish Governance Board (VGB)
and implemented procedures so no project asset have a Truck Factor
less than 3.

The Varnish Governance Board is the ultimate authority in the
project, but does little to nothing on a daily basis.

The important thing is that there is agreement beforehand about who
has the authority to step in, if need be.

Appointment to the VGB is by acclamation, and we prefer the members
to have enough distance and neutrality to be able to resolve
conflicts, should it ever become necessary.

Current members of the VGB:

* Rogier Mulhuijzen
* Lasse Karstensen
* Poul-Henning Kamp
