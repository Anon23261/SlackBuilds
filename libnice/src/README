nice

Nice is an implementation of the IETF's draft Interactive Connectivity
Establishment standard (ICE). It provides GLib-based library, libnice.
ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP
data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides
security against some attacks. Existing standards that use ICE include
the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Jingle, XMPP extension for
audio/video calls.
