vnStat (a console-based network traffic monitor)

vnStat is a network traffic monitor for Linux that keeps a log of 
daily network traffic for the selected interface(s). vnStat isn't a 
packetsniffer. The traffic information is analyzed from the /proc 
filesystem so vnStat can be used without root permissions. This 
program is open source (GPL) and can be installed in 'single' and 
'root' mode.
