tcptraceroute (traceroute implementation using TCP packets)

The more traditional traceroute(8) sends out either UDP or ICMP ECHO
packets with a TTL of one, and increments the TTL until the 
destination has been reached. By printing the gateways that generate
ICMP time exceeded messages along the way, it is able to determine
the path packets are taking to reach the destination.
