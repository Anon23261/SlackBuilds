# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

tcptraceroute: tcptraceroute (traceroute implementation using TCP packets)
tcptraceroute:
tcptraceroute: The more traditional traceroute(8) sends out either UDP or ICMP ECHO
tcptraceroute: packets with a TTL of one, and increments the TTL until the 
tcptraceroute: destination has been reached. By printing the gateways that generate
tcptraceroute: ICMP time exceeded messages along the way, it is able to determine
tcptraceroute: the path packets are taking to reach the destination.
