Slackers.it (repository for Slackware -current)

================================================================================

Repository contain a 'src' directory

The 'src' directory contains everything (SlackBuild script, slack-desc file,
plus all possible patch) you'll need when you want to build the packages yourself.

For make package from slackbuild do

# cd <program>/src

Download source code:
# source <program>.info
# wget -c $DOWNLOAD
if SOURCE variable is present in info file
# wget -c $DOWNLOAD -O $SOURCE

Build:
# sh <program>.SlackBuild

to build a package which will be created in the same directory.

If you have any questions or requests,
you can contact me at slackers.it (at) gmail (dot) com
