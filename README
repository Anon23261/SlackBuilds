Slackers.it (repository for Slackware -current)

================================================================================

Repository contain a 'src', a 'pkg' and a 'pkg64' directory.

The 'src' directory contains everything (SlackBuild script, slack-desc file,
plus all possible patch) you'll need when you want to build the packages yourself.

The 'pkg' directory contains the binary packages, ready for installation using
'installpkg' or 'upgradepkg'. You'll find *.txz (the package itself),
*.txt (the package description) and *.md5 (containing the md5 checksum of the
package) files in each 'pkg' directory.

The 'pkg64' directory contains the 64bit binary packages and other files as the
directory 'pkg'

For make package from slackbuild do

# cd <program>/src
# sh <program>.SlackBuild

to build a package which will be created in the same directory.

you can contact me at slackers.it (at) gmail (dot) com
