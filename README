Slackers.it (repository for Slackware -current)

================================================================================

Repository contain contains everything (SlackBuild script, slack-desc file,
plus all possible patch) you'll need when you want to build the packages yourself.

To make package from slackbuild do

# cd <program>

Download source code:
# source <program>.info
# wget -c $DOWNLOAD
if exists SOURCE variable, do instead
# wget -c $DOWNLOAD -O $SOURCE

if exists EXTRAFILE variables, do also
# wget -c $EXTRAFILE1 [$EXTRAFILE2]

Build:
# sh <program>.SlackBuild

to build a package which will be created in the same directory.

If you have any questions or requests,
you can contact me at slackers.it (at) gmail (dot) com
