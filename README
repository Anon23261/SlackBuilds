================================================================================

Repository contain contains everything (SlackBuild script, slack-desc file,
plus all possible patch) you'll need when you want to build the packages yourself.

To make package from slackbuild do

# cd <program>

Download source code:
# source <program>.info
# wget [--no-check-certificate] [--content-disposition] -c $DOWNLOAD

If exists FILENAME variable means that it contains the filename.

if exists DOWNLOAD extra variables, do also
# wget --no-check-certificate --content-disposition -c $DOWNLOAD_XXX [$EXTRAFILE_YYY]

Build:
# sh <program>.SlackBuild

to build a package which will be created in the same directory.

If you have any questions or requests,
