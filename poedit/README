Poedit 

Poedit is cross-platform gettext catalogs (.po files) editor. It is
built with wxWidgets toolkit and can run on any platform supported by
it (although it was only tested on Unix with GTK+ and Windows).
It aims to provide more convenient approach to editing catalogs than
launching vi and editing the file by hand.
