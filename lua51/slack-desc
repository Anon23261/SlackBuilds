W TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

lua51:
lua51: Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description 
lua51: constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics.
lua51: Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a 
lua51: register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management
lua51: with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for
lua51: configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
