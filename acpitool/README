acpitool (Configuration and Power Interface client Linux)

This is an ACPI client for Linux, written by David Leemans.
This ACPI client is intended to be a replacement for the apm tool.
Even though APM works fine on a lot of laptops, it is deprecated and
will be replaced by ACPI. Most newer laptops even require ACPI to
boot properly. As such, it will be nice to have an ACPI client.
