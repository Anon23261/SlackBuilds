sslh (SSL/SSH/OpenVPN/XMPP/tinc port multiplexer)

sslh accepts HTTPS, SSH, OpenVPN, tinc and XMPP connections on the
same port. This makes it possible to connect to any of these servers
on port 443 (e.g. from inside a corporate firewall, which almost
never block port 443) while still serving HTTPS on that port.

Edit config file /etc/default/sslh
