nmon -?

Outputs a hint on nmon use:

Hint: nmon [-h] [-s <seconds>] [-c <count>] [-f -d <disks> -t -r <name>] [-x]
        -h            FULL help information
        Interactive-Mode:
        read startup banner and type: "h" once it is running
        For Data-Collect-Mode (-f)
        -f            spreadsheet output format [note: default -s300 -c288]
        optional
        -s <seconds>  between refreshing the screen [default 2]
        -c <number>   of refreshes [default millions]
        -d <disks>    to increase the number of disks [default 256]
        -t            spreadsheet includes top processes;
        -x            capacity planning (15 min for 1 day = -fdt -s 900 -c 96)

nmon -h

Outputs the hint above and the following:

For Interactive-Mode
        -s <seconds>  between refreshing the screen [default 2]
        -c <number>   of refreshes [default millions]
        -g <filename> User Defined Disk Groups [hit g to show them]
                      - file = on each line: group_name <disks list> sapce separated
                      - like: database sdb sdc sdd sde
                      - upto 32 disk groups, disks can appear more than once
        -b            black and white [default is colour]
        example: nmon -s 1 -c 100

For Data-Collect-Mode = spreadsheet format (comma separated values)
        Note: use only one of f,F,z,x or X and make it the first argument
        -f            spreadsheet output format [note: default -s300 -c288]
        \t\t output file is <hostname>_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.nmon
        -F <filename> same as -f but user supplied filename
        -r <runname>  goes into spreadsheet file [default hostname]
        -t            include top processes in the output
        -T            as -t plus saves command line arguments in UARG section
        -s <seconds>  between snap shots
        -c <number>   of refreshes
        -d <disks>    to increase the number of disks [default 256]
        -l <dpl>      disks/line default 150 to avoid spreadsheet issues. EMC=64.
        -g <filename> User Defined Disk Groups (see above)

        -N            include NFS Network File System
        -I <percent>  Include precoess and disks busy threshold (default 0.1)
                      don't save or show proc/disk using less than this percent
        -m <directory> nmon changes to this directory before saving to file
        -D            Skip disk configuration sections
        example: collect for 1 hour at 30 second intervals with top procs
        \t nmons -f -t -r Test1 -s30 -c120

        To load into a spreadsheet like Lotus 1-2-3:
        sort -A *nmon >stats.csv
        transfer the stats.csv file to your PC
        Start 1-2-3 and then Open <char-separated-value ASCII file>

Capacity planning mode - use cron to run each day
        -x            sensible spreadsheet output for CP =  one day
                      every 15 mins for 1 day ( i.e. -ft -s 900 -c 96)
        -X            sensible spreadsheet output for CP = busy hour
                      every 30 secs for 1 hour ( i.e. -ft -s 30 -c 120)

Set-up and installation
        - this adds the disk % busy numbers (otherwise they are zero)
        If you have hundreds of disk this can take 1%% to 2%% CPU

Interactive Mode Commands
        key --- Toggles to control what is displayed ---
        h   = Online help information
        r   = Machine type, machine name, cache details and OS version + LPAR
        c   = CPU by processor stats with bar graphs
        l   = long term CPU (over 75 snapshots) with bar graphs
        m   = Memory stats
        V   = Virtual Memory and Swap stats
        k   = Kernel Internal stats
        n   = Network stats and errors
        N   = NFS Network File System
        d   = Disk I/O Graphs
        D   = Disk I/O Stats
        o   = Disk I/O Map (one character per disk showing how busy it is)
#ifdef PARTITIONS
        P   = Partitions Disk I/O Stats
#endif
#ifdef POWER
        p   = Logical Partitions Stats
#endif
        b   = black and white mode (or use -b option)
        .   = minimum mode i.e. only busy disks and processes

        key --- Other Controls ---
        +   = double the screen refresh time
        -   = halves the screen refresh time
        q   = quit (also x, e or control-C)
        0   = reset peak counts to zero (peak = ">")
        space = refresh screen now

        artup Control
        If you find you always type the same toggles every time you start
        then place them in the NMON shell variable. For example:
         export NMON=cmdrvtan

        hers:
        a) To you want to stop nmon - kill -USR2 <nmon-pid>
        b) Use -p and nmon outputs the background process pid
        c) To limit the processes nmon lists (online and to a file)
           Either set NMONCMD0 to NMONCMD63 to the program names
           or use -C cmd:cmd:cmd etc. example: -C ksh:vi:syncd
        d) If you want to pipe nmon output to other commands use a FIFO:
           mkfifo /tmp/mypipe
           nmon -F /tmp/mypipe &
           grep /tmp/mypipe
        e) If nmon fails please report it with:
           1) nmon version like: 12b
           2) the output of cat /proc/cpuinfo
           3) some clue of what you were doing
           4) I may ask you to run the debug version
