Valgrind (A tool to help find memory-management problems in programs)

Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic
analysis tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically
detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your
programs in detail. You can also use Valgrind to build new tools.
