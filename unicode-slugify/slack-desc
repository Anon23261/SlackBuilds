# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

unicode-slugify:
unicode-slugify: Unicode Slugify is a slugifier that generates unicode slugs.
unicode-slugify: It was originally used in the Firefox Add-ons web site to generate
unicode-slugify: slugs for add-ons and add-on collections. Many of these add-ons and
unicode-slugify: collections had unicode characters and required more than simple
unicode-slugify: transliteration.
