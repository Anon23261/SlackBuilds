libconfig (C/C++ Configuration File Library)

Libconfig is a simple library for processing structured configuration
files, like this one: test.cfg.
This file format is more compact and more readable than XML.
And unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string
parsing in application code.
