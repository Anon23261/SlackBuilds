# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

npm-bower: Bower offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of
npm-bower: front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency
npm-bower: model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build
npm-bower: stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are
npm-bower: shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.
