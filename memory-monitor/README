Memory monitor

This is a small Qt4 based application for detailed monitoring of the
memory usage of a running Linux application. Any application can be
monitored by picking it from a dropdown list. Memory monitor will
sample the app each second and draw a plot of memory usage over time.
It can also show mapped memory.
